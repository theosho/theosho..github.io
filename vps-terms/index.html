We highly recommend that Customers avoid publishing online personal data that could be abused.</p>

			<li>SERVICE GUARANTEES<br><br>
        <p align="justify">Ktm Webhosting guarantees 99.9% network uptime and server stability. This, however, does not refer to problems stemming from:</p>
        
        <ol type="a">
          	<li><p align="justify">Server Hardware Breakdown;</p></li>
          	<li><p align="justify">User error(s) or purposeful interruption(s) of the user service (e.g. if the client shuts his/her own server down, Ktm Webhosting is not responsible for the downtime);</p>
          	</li>
		  	<li><p align="justify">Failure due to software that is not explicitly supported by Ktm Webhosting. If a hardware crash provoked by the Customer consequently happens, Ktm Webhosting is beyond the control and responsibility for the resulting downtime.</p>
			</li>
        </ol>
		<p align="justify">For more information, please refer to our <a href="..\vps-service-level-guarantees\index.html">Service Level Guarantees</a>.</p>
      </li><br><br>
      <li>DATA BACKUP<br><br>
        <p align="justify">Due to the specificity of the VPS service, providing Customers with fully independent and self-managed hosting environment, the DATA BACKUP of all Customer's website contents and databases is solely Customer's responsibility, as well. </p>

	<li><strong>SERVICE ACTIVATION AND CONTINUANCE TIMESCALES</strong><br><br>
	   <ol><li>SERVICE ACTIVATION<br><br>
	   <p align="justify"><u>For newly signed up clients</u> - the services are activated immediately after our Sales Department gets in touch with the Customer over the phone to verify the payment details (this is required due to the high fraud activity spreading online, and in order to be prevented fraudulent account usage). The payment verification procedure is obligatory and if we fail to approve a transaction within 48 hours of the payment submission, the funds will be credited back to the payer and the order will be canceled. 
<br><br>
<u>For existing customers</u> – the services for existing Customers, including upgrade services and renewals, are activated immediately after our Sales Department receives the according service payment.
		</p></li><br><br>
      </ol></li>
      <li>CONTINUANCE TIMESCALES<br><br>
        <p align="justify"><u>VPS Accounts</u> – The newly-created VPS hosting accounts with Ktm Webhosting are valid for 1 month. They can be renewed on a monthly basis, i.e. for another month that will be added to the official expiration date of the VPS server account.</p>
		<p align="justify"><u>Domain Name Registrations/Transfers</u> – Ktm Webhosting offers for registration/transfer all TLDs (Top-Level Domains) displayed in the table below. A domain name can be purchased either at sign up together with the VPS account (at a regular or PROMOTIONAL price) or separately (later on) as an upgrade from the Customer's Billing Manager. The Customer agrees to abide by Ktm Webhosting's <a href="..\domain-name-registration-agreement\index.html">Domain Name Registration Agreement</a> and <a href="..\domain-name-resolution-policy\index.html">Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</a>.

		<p align="justify"><u>Domain Renewals</u> – Domain names are valid for the period of their registration (domain names can be registered for up to 10 years, depending on the domain name's TLD extension). After the expiration of a domain name several stages follow regarding its renewal.</p><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li><p align="justify">The domain name <strong>Redemption Grace Period (RGP)</strong> is a registry level period of up to 30 days after a domain name's expiration date. During this period the domain name is kept on hold by the Registrar before it gets deleted. The domain registrant is allowed to retrieve the domain name from deletion, but this process costs additional redemption fee. This extra 30-day period extends the time available for renewing domain names. However, all domains that enter a redemption period are removed from the zone files (the list of domain names currently in the global DNS), therefore any web site or e-mail services associated with the domain name will stop working.</p></li>
					<li><p align="justify"><strong>Extended Redemption Grace Period</strong> – the extended redemption period adds another 7 – 30 days to the domain name's redemption period. During this period the domain name owner is allowed to retrieve the domain name from deletion by contacting the domain's registrar.</p></li>
					<li><p align="justify">After the redemption period of an expired domain name is over, follows the <strong>Pending Delete Period</strong> – a registry level period of up to 5 days during which no one is allowed to renew the domain name and it cannot be newly registered because it's still not returned to the public pool of domain names.</p></li>
					<li><p align="justify"><strong>Released by Registry Period</strong> – after the domain name's ‘Pending Delete Period' is over, the domain name is released back into the public pool of domain names and is newly available for registration.</p></li>
				</ul><br><br>
		<p align="justify">We strongly recommend that Customers renew their domain registrations before their domain names are placed into redemption period. After a domain name transits in redemption period, we are not able to prevent its zone files from being removed from the DNS system, and any web site and associated services will cease working.</p>
		<p align="justify">We can assist Customers in retrieving their domain names only if the domain names were registered with us. Customers will be charged a REDEMPTION FEE of $270.00 USD for each domain registration renewal. If the domain name was registered with another registrar, the Customer needs to contact that registrar for more information regarding its retrieving.</p><br><br>

	<li><strong>CANCELLATION, REFUND & MONEY-BACK; CHARGEBACKS</strong><br><br>
        <ol>
        	<li>CANCELLATIONS<br><br>
			<p align="justify">In order to cancel a VPS account, the Customer must send a support ticket to Ktm Webhosting's Sales Department via his/her Billing Manager and provide any authentication credentials requested by Ktm Webhosting. Any other form of cancellation request will not be accepted.</p>
			</li>
            <li>REFUNDS<br><br>
			<p align="justify"><u>VPS accounts</u> – The VPS accounts are set up on a monthly prepay basis. Customers may cancel their accounts at any time, however they will not be entitled to a refund for the unused period of the prepaid month, since these services do NOT include Money Back Guarantee. Any incentives offered to the Customers upon sign-up will be also canceled.</p>
			<p align="justify"><u>Domain Name Registrations/Transfers</u> – Domain name registrations/transfers are also treated as non-refundable services and cannot be canceled or refunded after activated upon Customer request. The domain name owner will have access to a domain management account, and will be able to transfer the domain name to another registrar.</p>
			</li>
            <li>CHARGEBACKS<br><br>
			<p align="justify">Chargebacks are not considered as a way of refunding. Any Customer who initiates a credit card chargeback in response to a bill or order placed with Ktm Webhosting will be subject to full investigation. </p>
			<p align="justify">When signing up for a VPS account with Ktm Webhosting, the Customer agrees to the terms and conditions explicated in this document (and its coherent policies). Thus, Ktm Webhosting, as well as Ktm Webhosting's authorized retailers (PayPal, WorldPay, 2CheckOut), will resort to these documents as an evidence for the Customer's agreement, especially in the event that a Customer sends a chargeback inquiry based on points that he/or she first accepted, but is trying now to refute.</p>
			<p align="justify">If/When a chargeback report is received, the first step of Ktm Webhosting's Customer Care team will be to try to contact the user. Meanwhile, the Customer's VPS account will be suspended (in order to protect our system from fraudulent activity and misuse) and will remain suspended until the reasons for the chargeback have been clarified and decision has been taken for according action. </p>
			<p align="justify">If the chargeback has occurred due to some misunderstanding, a reverse payment procedure will be initiated with the authorized retailers and eventually the account will be re-activated. </p>
			<p align="justify">If the Customer has sent a chargeback request based on groundless argumentations (according to Ktm Webhosting's own judgment and these VPS Terms of Service), then a dispute will be started with the authorized retailers in which the VPS Terms of Service and the AUP of Ktm Webhosting will serve as evidence of the Customer's agreement. The retailers then, taking into consideration all provisions in these legal documents, will decide whether the Customer has had sufficient grounds for the chargeback or Ktm Webhosting has the right to a reverse payment.</p>
			<p align="justify">In case that the chargeback originates from a fraudulent user (end-client) and no reverse payment procedure can be activated, then the respective VPS account will remain suspended and a $30 USD fee will be withdrawn from the commission of the reseller (the client of our Free Reseller Hosting Program) whose client's account (the end-client) has been the reason for the chargeback (in order to be covered the fees imposed to Ktm Webhosting from our authorized retailers for the claimed unauthorized transaction).  </p>
