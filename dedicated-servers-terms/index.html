<p>
	This is an Agreement between You - Customer of our Dedicated Hosting Services, and the following companies, which partner with Ktm Webhosting - LiquidNet US LLC, a US company headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and LiquidNet Ltd., a UK company headquartered in London, UK. Legal details about the two companies can be found in the 'Customer Service Contact Details' section of this document. For the sake of brevity, Ktm Webhosting, LiquidNet US LLC and LiquidNet Ltd. will be referred to as 'Ktm Webhosting' in this document. 
</p>

<p>
	When signing up for a Dedicated server hosting account with Ktm Webhosting, the Customer agrees to 
	abide by the rules and provisions explicated in these Dedicated Terms of Service, as well as all 
	their coherent policies (Order Verification Policy, <a href="..\dedicated-server-acceptable-use-policy\index.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a>, etc.) mentioned herein.
</p>
<p>
	The Customer of our Services should also be aware that when signing up for a Dedicated server 
	hosting account with Ktm Webhosting, he/or she agrees to position data on our servers and make 
	it accessible to the wide internet public. In this respect, the Customer understands and agrees 
	that it is beyond the power of Ktm Webhosting to restrict any public access to this data and 
	guarantee the security of the Customer's files. The Customer, therefore, is completely in 
	charge of protecting his/her web content on our Dedicated servers and should consider carefully 
	each piece of information before uploading it to his/her newly allocated Dedicated server space. 
	We highly recommend that Customers avoid publishing online personal data that could be abused.

<ol type="I">
	<li>
		<h2>SERVICE AGREEMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
		<p>
			Ktm Webhosting shall provide its Services to You - the Customer - under the Terms and 
			Conditions explicated in this Service Agreement. The Agreement is intended to keep the 
			integrity of both Ktm Webhosting and the Customer and to protect both parties from liability. 
			This Service Agreement will be enforced to ensure the speed, power, performance, 
			and reliability of our Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Service Agreement, together with the Order Form, the <a href="..\dedicated-server-acceptable-use-policy\index.html">Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</a>, 
			and any other policies or agreements mentioned in this document, constitute the whole 
			act of convention between Ktm Webhosting and the Customer. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>RULES FOR ACTIVATION AND MONTHLY PAYMENT BASIS OF THE DEDICATED SERVER HOSTING SERVICE</h2>
		<p>
			Upon submitting of the online order form, the Customer agrees to abide by our <a href="..\order-verification-policy\index.html">Order Verification Policy</a> and the following provisions:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The payment of the Dedicated server hosting service is set up on a monthly basis. 
				The Customer agrees to pay for the rendered Dedicated server hosting services in 
				advance for each monthly service term.
			</li>
			<li>
				Non-Payment of the service shall result in a immediate service disconnection. 
				Customers failing to secure payment by the time of the due date will incur service 
				interruption. The data hosted on the Dedicated server will be kept for one month, 
				after that it will be permanently deleted.  
			</li>
			<li>
				Setup fees and monthly service fees are non-refundable. The Customer agrees to 
				a no-refund policy in advance.  
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>SERVICE GUARANTEES; DATA BACKUP</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h4>SERVICE GUARANTEES</h4>
				<p>
					Ktm Webhosting guarantees 99.9% network uptime and server stability. 
					This, however, does not refer to problems stemming from: 
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Server Hardware Breakdown;
					</li>
					<li>
						User error(s) or purposeful interruption(s) of the user service 
						(e.g. if the client shuts his/her own server down, Ktm Webhosting 
						is not responsible for the downtime);
					</li>
					<li>
						Failure due to software that is not explicitly supported by the 
						Ktm Webhosting. If a hardware crash provoked by the Customer consequently 
						happens, Ktm Webhosting is beyond the control and responsibility for 
						the resulting downtime.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					For more information, please refer to our <a href="..\dedicated-serveres-service-guarantees\index.html">Service Level Guarantees</a>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>DATA BACKUP</h4>
				<p>
					Each Customer will get a default backup space quota of 100 GB, which they can avail of at any given moment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, each Google Drive and/or Dropbox account owner is entitled to another 100 GB of backup space.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        A 50 GB backup storage option is available as part of our Managed Services package as well. 
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>SERVICE ACTIVATION AND CONTINUANCE TIMESCALES</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>SERVICE ACTIVATION</h3>
				<p>
					For newly signed up clients - the Services are activated only after our Sales Department gets in touch with the Customer over the phone to verify the payment details (this is required due to the high fraud activity spreading online, and in order to prevent fraudulent account usage). The payment verification procedure is obligatory and if we fail to approve a transaction within 48 hours of the payment submission, the funds will be credited back to the payer and the order will be canceled.
				</p>
				<p>
					For existing customers - the services for existing Customers, including 
					upgrade services and renewals, are activated immediately after our Sales 
					Department receives the according service payment.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>CONTINUANCE TIMESCALES</h3>
				<p>
					Dedicated Server Accounts - The newly-created Dedicated server 
					hosting accounts with Ktm Webhosting are valid for 1 month. They can be 
					renewed on a monthly basis, i.e. for another month that will be added 
					to the official expiration date of the Dedicated server account.
				</p>
				<p>
					Domain Name Registrations/Transfers - Ktm Webhosting offers for 
					registration/transfer all TLDs (Top-Level Domains) displayed in the table below. 
					A domain name can be purchased either at sign up together with the Dedicated 
					server hosting account (at a regular or PROMOTIONAL price) or separately 
					(later on) as an upgrade from the Customer's Dedicated management account. 
					The Customer agrees to abide by Ktm Webhosting's <a href="..\domain-name-registration-agreement\index.html">Domain Name Registration 
					Agreement</a> and <a href="..\domain-name-resolution-policy\index.html">Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</a>. The table below displays 
					the minimum and maximum registration periods, as well as the annual NON-PROMOTIONAL 
					prices of all TLDs:

				<p>
					Domain Renewals - Even though Ktm Webhosting will provide regular reminders about the expiration of the domain name(s) registered through the company, it is your obligation to keep track of when the registration service(s) will expire. Should you fail to renew a domain name before its expiration date, the domain name will be suspended or canceled.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						After a domain name’s expiration date, there is a period of 30 days, in which the domain name can be renewed. Certain domain name extensions do not have such a period, so leaving a domain name to expire before attempting a renewal is at your own discretion.
					</li>
					<li>
						After the 30-day renewal period has passed, some domain names (as per TLD Registry Policies) enter a so-called Redemption Grace Period. A domain name which has entered a Redemption Grace Period can still be renewed. However, additional fees will be added to the domain's renewal price. You can find the official information regarding the Redemption Grace Period on ICANN’s page: <a href="http://www.icann.org/registrars/redemption-proposal-14feb02.htm">http://www.icann.org/registrars/redemption-proposal-14feb02.htm</a>.<br>
If a Redemption Grace Period is applicable for a specific domain name, it will last between 30 and 42 days.
					</li>
					<li>
						After the Redemption Grace Period (or the renewal period – if RGP is not applicable) has passed, domain name(s) can be: provided to third parties; Ktm Webhosting may choose to auction the domain name(s); Ktm Webhosting may return them in the public registration pool. All of these actions can be carried out at any time and without your consent.					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					We strongly recommend that Customers renew their domain registrations before their 
					domain names are placed into redemption period. After a domain name transits in 
					redemption period, we are not able to prevent its zone files from being removed 
					from the DNS system, and any web site and associated services will cease working.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can assist Customers in retrieving their domain names only if the domain names 
					were registered with us. Customers will be charged a REDEMPTION FEE of $270.00 USD 
					for each domain registration renewal. If the domain name was registered with another 
					registrar, the Customer needs to contact that registrar for more information 
					regarding its retrieving. 
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

	<li>
		<h2>CANCELLATION, REFUND & MONEY-BACK; CHARGEBACKS</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>CANCELLATIONS</h3>
				<p>
					In order to cancel a Dedicated server account, the Customer must send a support 
					ticket to Ktm Webhosting's Sales Department via his/her Dedicated management account 
					and provide any authentication credentials requested by Ktm Webhosting. Any other form 
					of cancellation request will not be accepted.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>REFUNDS</h3>
				<p>
					Dedicated server hosting accounts - The Dedicated server accounts are set up 
					on a monthly prepay basis. Customers may cancel their accounts at any time, 
					however they will not be entitled to a refund for the unused period of the 
					prepaid month, since these services do NOT include Money Back Guarantee. 
					Any incentives offered to the Customers upon sign-up will be also canceled. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Domain Name Registrations/Transfers - Domain name registrations/transfers 
					are also treated as non-refundable services and cannot be canceled or refunded 
					after activated upon Customer request. The domain name owner will have access to 
					a domain management account, and will be able to transfer the domain name to 
					another registrar.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>CHARGEBACKS</h3>
				<p>
					Chargebacks are not considered as a way of refunding. Any Customer who 
					initiates a credit card chargeback in response to a bill or order placed with 
					Ktm Webhosting will be subject to full investigation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When signing up for a Dedicated server hosting account with Ktm Webhosting, 
					the Customer agrees to the terms and conditions explicated in this document 
					(and its coherent policies). Thus, Ktm Webhosting, as well as Ktm Webhosting's 
					authorized retailers (PayPal, WorldPay, 2CheckOut), will resort to these 
					documents as an evidence for the Customer's agreement, especially in the 
					event that a Customer sends a chargeback inquiry based on points that he/or 
					she first accepted, but is trying now to refute.
				</p>
					If/When a chargeback report is received, the first step of Ktm Webhosting's 
					Customer Care team will be to try to contact the Customer. Meanwhile, the 
					Customer's Dedicated server account will be suspended (in order to protect 
					our system from fraudulent activity and misuse) and will remain suspended 
					until the reasons for the chargeback have been clarified and decision has 
					been taken for according action. 
				<p>
					If the chargeback has occurred due to some misunderstanding, a reverse payment 
					procedure will be initiated with the authorized retailers and eventually the 
					Dedicated server account will be re-activated. 
				</p>
					If the Customer has sent a chargeback request based on groundless argumentations 
					(according to Ktm Webhosting's own judgment and these Dedicated Terms of Service), 
					then a dispute will be started with the authorized retailers in which the Dedicated 
					Terms of Service and the AUP of Ktm Webhosting will serve as evidence of the 
					Customer's agreement. The retailers then, taking into consideration all provisions 
					in these legal documents, will decide whether the Customer has had sufficient 
					grounds for the chargeback or Ktm Webhosting has the right to a reverse payment.
				<p>
					In case that the chargeback originates from a fraudulent user (end-client) 
					and no reverse payment procedure can be activated, then the respective Dedicated 
					server account will remain suspended and a $30 USD fee will be withdrawn from the 
					commission of the reseller (the client of our Free Reseller Hosting Program) whose 
					client's account (the end-client) has been the reason for the chargeback (in order 
					to be covered the fees imposed to Ktm Webhosting from our authorized retailers for 
					the claimed unauthorized transaction).  
				</p>

	<li>
		<h2>HOSTING RESELLER TOOLS</h2>
		<p>
			A collection of free hosting reseller tools : a free billing software (ClientExec) 
			and a free domain reseller account is available with each Dedicated Server hosting package. 
			All bonuses are given per customer's request.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES; ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT</h2>
		<p>
			In consideration of their use of the Service, Customers agree to:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Provide <a href="..\privacy-policy\index.html">true, accurate, current and complete information</a> about themselves as 
				prompted by the registration form of the Service. Maintain and promptly update 
				their registration data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If the 
				Customer provides any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or 
				incomplete, or Ktm Webhosting has reasonable grounds (at its sole discretion) 
				to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, 
				Ktm Webhosting has the right to suspend or terminate the Customer's account and 
				refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). 
				If untrue details are used in order to avoid VAT the customer can be held 
				responsible by the respective national tax collecting agency. 
			</li>
			<li>
				When introducing any changes to their contact details, Customers are obliged to 
				notify Ktm Webhosting in the course of 10 business days after the changes become valid. 
				The introduction of changes should be done online through the customers' Dedicated 
				Management Account, not via e-mail.
			</li>
			<li>
				Customers will receive a password and account designation upon completing of the 
				registration process of the Service. Customers are responsible for keeping the 
				confidentiality of their passwords and accounts, and are fully responsible for 
				all activities that occur under that password or account. Customers agree to: 
				<ol>
					<li>
						immediately notify Ktm Webhosting about any unauthorized use of their password or 
						account or any other breach of security;
					</li> 
					<li>
						ensure that they safely exit (log out from) 
						their account at the end of each session.
					</li>
				</ol>
				Ktm Webhosting cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage of account
				information arising from Customer's failure to comply with this provision.
			</li>
			<li>
				If a Dedicated server hosting account is registered with details different than those 
				of the person who paid for the account, and in the case of any dispute, Ktm Webhosting 
				will take the side of the person who paid for the account and shall not provide access 
				to any other person, since - a hosting account owner is and will be considered to be the 
				credit card /PayPal account holder.  
			</li>
			<li>
				The client is obliged not to delete Ktm Webhosting's SSH key, which provides root access 
				to the server. The root access will be used by Ktm Webhosting in 2 cases only:
				<ol>
					<li>
						When there is a problem with the server and, as a result, certain services 
						do not run properly - Ktm Webhosting may fix it as he sees fit.
					</li>
					<li>
						When there is a report from a third party concerning some sort of abuse, 
						for example, spam, Ktm Webhosting can identify the spammer and suspend him, 
						of which case the client who is in charge of the server will be duly informed. 
						The client, on the other hand, is obliged not to let problems of such kind happen 
						again, whether or not involving that particular abuser. If there are repeated 
						abuse reports - Ktm Webhosting will charge the client $20 for each report, 
						because the latter is obviously unwilling to assist in terminating the abuse 
						actions on the given server.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The client is also obliged not to terminate the SNMP service activated by Ktm Webhosting to keep track of the used IPs on the server. Upon a termination of the 	
			SNMP service -Ktm Webhosting will inform the client and the client will have to 	
			reactivate the service in 48 hours. If 	the client does not cooperate - Ktm Webhosting 	
			can suspend the client's access to the server at his own discretion.
