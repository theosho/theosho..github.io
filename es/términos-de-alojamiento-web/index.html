HOSTING SERVICES</span></strong><br>
    <br>
A web hosting service is a type of Internet service that offers
individuals and organizations/companies the resources to host their own
web sites and store information, images, video, and other content
accessible via the World Wide Web. A Storage Service Provider (SSP) is
a company that provides computer storage space and related management
services. SSPs offer also periodic backup and archiving. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
Ktm Webhosting offers only web hosting services, not data storage
services. A web hosting service consists of the following: &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
SERVICE FEATURES<br>
    <br>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disk Space</span>
- We use a clustered storage technology. This means that the storage
resources of a hosting plan purchased from us are not confined to a
single server, but are distributed between multiple machines. This way
optimal performance is guaranteed and higher server stability. It also
ensures that you will be able to avail of all the storage quota that
has been assigned to your particular account. Additional disk space is
available as an upgrade option. Payment is accepted only in advance per
year. Contact sales for more information.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Traffic</span>
- Each hosting plan includes prepaid monthly traffic in Megabytes. This
traffic quota is shared between all sites hosted in a single account.
In case that a hosting account exceeds its allowed traffic quota, it
will be suspended until the beginning of next month when the quota will
refresh automatically. Additional traffic is available as upgrade.
Contact sales for more information.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hosted Domains</span>
- Ktm Webhosting's hosting plans include domain hosting. Each hosting
plan allows a particular number of domains that can be hosted.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Domain
Registration/Transfer</span> - available at regular or a
discounted price (depending on the chosen TLD) with the purchasing of a
web hosting account. Each account can host a maximum of one discounted
domain name. Domain registrations are final and are not subject to
refund. More information regarding domain names can be found further in
this TOS (Terms of Service), in our Domain Name Registration Agreement
and in the Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">E-mail
accounts</span>
- different number of e-mail accounts are available for setup with each
web hosting plan. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">MySQL/PostgreSQL
Database(s)</span> - MySQL databases are included in all web
hosting plans. Additional databases are available as upgrade.
PostgreSQL databases can be either included or optional. Contact sales
for more information.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Database
Storage</span>
- Each hosting account has a limit of database storage. This storage is
shared between all the databases in a single hosting account.
Additional database storage is available. Contact sales for pricing.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">IP Address</span>
- Ktm Webhosting's hosting accounts do not include dedicated IP addresses, unless listed in plan features. Dedicated IP addresses can be purchased at any time as an upgrade to the web hosting service provided by Ktm Webhosting. Dedicated IP addresses are purchased for a period of at least one year and are non-transferable to other web hosting providers. Contact sales for more information.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NB:</span> Please note that according to IANA - the entity that coordinates the global pool of IPs, newly requested dedicated IP addresses must be used within 7 days of their allocation. So, if you request a dedicated IP address from your Control Panel and do not assign it to a host within 7 days of the allocation date, then the IP address will be taken back to the global pool of IPs. If so, you will need to re-request the IP address from the Dedicated IP Addresses section of your Control Panel.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SSH</span>
- In
case your hosting account does not include SSH, please contact sales
department for more information on how to obtain it. Payment is
accepted only in advance per year. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ID
Protection</span>
- This service ensures that your private contact information will not
be visible in the domain's WHOIS details. Optional for all hosting
plans, but available only with certain TLDs, supporting this option.
&nbsp;<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
Detailed information about all features included in our web hosting
packages is available on our web hosting plan pages.<br>
<br>
INSTALLATION AND TROUBLESHOOTING<br>
<br>Each customer will be able to take advantage of our Installation & Troubleshooting service upgrade. It allows users to get one-time expert assistance from our technical support team or system administrators for a period of 1 hour. The Installation & Troubleshooting is intended for:<br>
<br>
- Hacked sites cleaning and restoration service<br>
If you find your website hacked or reported to be infected you can rely on our help getting this fixed for you. This service included a backup of the current content, cleaning and/or restoring broken files from original script installation or restore from a previous copy.<br>
<br>
- Script, theme, plugin installation service<br>
If you need any software installation, theme/template or even plugin installation that you do not wish to deal with, we can do it for you. We will backup the current site (if any) and complete the desired installation for you.<br>
<br>
- Scripts troubleshooting and debugging services<br>
In case you have an issue with a software that you are unable to handle, we can do the troubleshooting and fix it for you.<br>
<br>
- Manual files, database or emails transfers between hosting accounts using our services. If you want to move a site or few over to another account we can handle the migration for you hassle free.<br>
<br>
The Installation & Troubleshooting will not apply in the following cases:<br>
<br>
- Our installation service covers only fresh installations (no upgrades). We will not perform custom work or upgrade to a recent version on an already existing scripts.<br>
- The service will not include any configuration of the scripts beyond their installation. After the scripts are being activated and operational any further tweaking and setup is done by the client.<br>
- We will only provide installation and troubleshooting if the hosting is provided by us on our Linux Based Servers. We do not provide the service for any Windows, Linux and MAC servers which are not powered and managed by us.<br>
- We don-t provide any warranties and will not be held responsible for any data loss or any script, theme, plugin not operating as intended.<br>
<br>
"UNLIMITED" USAGE POLICIES AND DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
The term “UNLIMITED” is used to describe the amount of resources in the web hosting plans provided by Ktm Webhosting, which is not set to a predefined limit value (for example - unlimited bandwidth, unlimited disk space, unlimited emails or other unlimited resources). By not setting limits on key resources, we are able to offer our customers a simple, consistent pricing scheme as their websites demand more and more resources. As a result, a typical website may experience periods of great popularity and a resulting increased storage need without experiencing any associated increase in hosting charges.<br>
<br>
In all cases, when a service is listed as “Unlimited“, it is intended for normal web hosting usage only - all activities, which may result in excessive resource usage inconsistent with regular usage patterns, are prohibited.<br>
<br>
Our Unlimited service offers are not designed to allow a single user to influence the overall server performance. Ktm Webhosting will make every effort to provide its customers with additional resources whenever possible, including the relocation of a customer's hosting account to a newer, faster server. However, if the resource usage reaches a level where it may influence the overall server performance in a negative way, Ktm Webhosting reserves the right to take corrective actions. Such actions may include disconnection or discontinuance of any and of all offered services, removal or deletion of customers' websites, website content, electronic mail, or termination of a customer's account according to Ktm Webhosting's sole and absolute discretion.<br>
    <br>
SERVICE PAYMENTS AND RECURRING CONTRACTS<br>
    <br>
When signing up for an account with Ktm Webhosting, the Customer
agrees to pay for the period of one year (365 days) and abide by our
Order Verification Policy. Our Sales Department will strictly
scrutinize each account order and carefully processes each payment in
order to ensure that no fraudulent user can take advantage of our web
hosting system. In cases of PayPal and American Express credit card payments, a 12-month recurring billing cycle will apply for customer convenience. In case that a customer wants to cancel their recurring contract, they can do so from the Recurring Manager section of their Web Hosting Control Panel.<br>
    <br>
Ktm Webhosting will charge customers with fees based on the fee
structure of our web hosting system at the time of the sign-up process.
Ktm Webhosting reserves the right to introduce price changes to the
packages when needed. This means that the current price list at our web
store may differ from the pricing of your web hosting account.<br>
    <br>
Each customer of ours will be able to take advantage of the package
he/she has purchased at the introductory price levels, and with one and
the same set of features in the course of the whole contract period.
Ktm Webhosting reserves the right to introduce certain changes to the
packages (in the form of complementary services) to the benefit of the
customers. <br>
    <br>
When you pay for a web hosting plan with a domain via credit card or PayPal, a 12-month recurring billing subscription will be created automatically for your convenience, for which you will get a notification from the payment processor. All automatic payments go through exactly 7 days before the due date so as to avoid any downtime to your websites if there is a problem with the credit card/PayPal account.
<br>
<br>
We’ll send you a reminder of the due payment at least 24 hours before the automatic charge takes place.
 <br>
<br>

SERVICE GUARANTEES &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
Ktm Webhosting guarantees 99.9% network uptime and server stability.
This, however, does not refer to problems stemming from: &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Server Hardware Breakdown;<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>User error(s) or purposeful interruption(s) of the user
service (e.g.
if the client shuts his/her own server down, Ktm Webhosting is not
responsible for the downtime);<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Failure due to software that is not explicitly
supported by Ktm Webhosting. If a hardware crash provoked by the
customer
consequently occurs, Ktm Webhosting is beyond the control and
responsibility for the resulting downtime.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
For more information, please read our Service Level Guarantees.<br>
    <br>
ACCOUNT/DATA BACKUP<br>
    <br>
Our backup service is provided as a courtesy to you and therefore, Ktm Webhosting will be in no way held responsible for the files stored in your account. You, as a customer, agree to take full responsibility for all the files in your account and to maintain an appropriate backup of the data stored on our servers. We will back up the files located in the /www folder of your account, as well as the databases you have created. Backups are only kept for a period of 7 days. After this period, a backup cannot be restored.
&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
<strong>General Backup</strong>: The default available backup disk storage space for each customer is 5 GB. User accounts with content over 5 GB cannot be (partially or entirely) backed up. Additional space for backup purposes is available under our Upgrade section in the Control Panel. We provide backup services only to accounts with disk space usage below the purchased backup quota limit. For example, if the purchased data backup quota amounts to 20 GB, we will back up your files as long as your account's disk usage does not exceed the 20 GB quota limit. As soon as this 20 GB quota limit has been reached - the backup script will no longer back up any of your files.<br>
<br>
<strong>Database Backup</strong>: Our database backup script WILL NOT back up databases, which contain more than 256 tables. Databases bigger than that take too much time and use too much of the server's resources to be backed up.<br>

    <strong><span id="FREE_DOMAIN_NAME_PROMOTION">FREE DOMAIN NAME PROMOTION</span></strong><br>
    <br>
Ktm Webhosting occasionally runs promotions offering FREE domain names
to customers signing up for a new web hosting account. This special
offer is valid only with our PROMOTIONAL TLDs. However, in case that
the money-back guarantee option is used, the domain name must be paid
($9.95 per year per domain name). The domain name owner will have
access to a domain management account, and will be able to transfer the
domain name to another registrar.

HOSTING SERVICE
    <br><p>The
hosting service
is active for one year (365 days). After the expiration of that
period, the account will be automatically suspended and will remain
suspended until the Customer renews it by paying its annual
subscription fee. In case that the Customer does not renew his/her
hosting account, it will remain BLOCKED. The account data will be
kept for two months, after that it will be permanently deleted.</p><br>
    <p>
E-mail
notifications
regarding each account's expiration are dispatched twice - 14
days and 7 days prior to the expiration date of the account. In order
to receive the notifications, the Customer must provide a valid
e-mail address. Ktm Webhosting ensures that the e-mails are sent and
takes no responsibility for e-mails that are not delivered due to
problems with the recipient's e-mail address. </p>
    <br><br>
DOMAIN NAMES
    <br><br>
    <p>
Domain
names are
valid for the number of years of their registration (domain names can
be registered for the period of 1 to 10 years, depending on their TLD
- top-level domain name - extension). After an expiration of a
domain name several stages follow regarding its renewal. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The
domain name <strong>Redemption Grace Period (RGP)</strong>
is a registry level period that starts about 30 days after the domain name's expiration date. During this period the domain name is kept on hold by the Registrar before it gets deleted. The domain registrant is allowed to retrieve the domain name from deletion, but this process costs additional redemption fee. The RGP fee depends on the given TLD and on the registrar through which it is registered as follows:
<br><br>
<table class="domains_table">
<tr>
<th>Registrar</th>
<th>TLD</th>
<th>RGP fee</th>

<td>$270.00</td>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
The RGP period extends the time available for renewing domain names. However, any web site or e-mail services associated with the domain name will stop working and the domains that enter a redemption period may be removed from the zone files (the list of domain names currently in the global DNS).
</p>
      </li>
        <li>
        <p>After the Redemption Grace Period (or the renewal period – if RGP is not applicable) has passed, domain name(s) enter  the so called <strong>ERGP (Extended Redemption Grace Period)</strong>. During the first 120 days of the period in which the domain name is appointed to its ERGP period you are allowed to redeem the domain name and take ownership  once again if you pay the fee for redeeming the domain name with all  registration fees. When the 120 period lapses and you have not redeemed the domain name, the domain name will be considered deserted and you would have no further rights over the domain name registration.<br><br>
     
At that point domain name(s) can be: provided to third parties; Ktm Webhosting may choose to auction the domain name(s);  Ktm Webhosting may return them in the public registration pool. All of these actions can be carried out at any time and without your  consent.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After the redemption period of an expired domain name is finished, comes the <strong>Pending Delete Period</strong>- a registry level period of up to 5 days during which no one is allowed to renew the domain name and it cannot be newly registered because it's still not returned to the public pool of domain names.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Released
by Registry Period</strong> - the domain name is sent back into the
public pool of domain names and is newly available for registration.</p>
      </li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>
Customers
are
advised to renew their domain registrations before their domain names
are placed into redemption. When a domain name transits in redemption
period, we are not able any more to prevent its zone files from being
removed from the DNS system, and the customer's web site and any
associated services will stop working.<br>
    <br>
During a domain name's
redemption period, we can assist the customer in retrieving his/her
domain name from deletion only if the domain name was registered with
us. The customer will need to pay a REDEMPTION FEE (see the table above for more information) for the domain registration renewal (the redemption
fee is
imposed by our Registrar). If the domain name was registered with
another registrar, the customer needs to contact that registrar for
more information regarding its retrieving. </p>

        <p>Ktm Webhosting strongly recommends that customers be
very judicious when using the
CPU power for their accounts. We reserve the right to block files or
scripts that excessively use CPU. We may suspend also the Customer
account in the case of registered impact on other accounts on the
server or disturbance caused to its functioning. If we do block or
suspend an account, then its owner will be notified of the situation
and given an explanation, and/or offered to upgrade to a dedicated or
a semi-dedicated web hosting solution
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Emails</b>
- Users are not allowed to send more than 1500 emails per day/150 emails per hour per hosting account (each email can be sent to a maximum of 50 recipients, as each unique recipient will be counted as one message sent). Users are not allowed to send more than 1500 emails a day using a mailing list (or 1 email to 1500 subscribers, respectively). Each email account is entitled to 10 GB of storage space, while all active email accounts under a hosting account must not exceed 40 GB in size. Only the Enterprise plan has an email storage quota of 60 GB.  Each email account can host up to 200.000 stored messages.</p>
<p>You can manage as many mailboxes as you need under one account as long as you do not interfere with the other users on the server.</p>
 
<p>If there are more than 3000 mailboxes in a given hosting account, its owner can cause high server load by just modifying a password or changing an alias.</p>
 
<p>This is why, if a particular mailbox simultaneously accommodates multiple emails and its owner often often executes changes like the ones mentioned above, then we’ll be forced to disable that account and ask the respective client to migrate to a more resource-rich type of a hosting environment where mailbox modification operations cannot lead to server performance issues.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>File
Quota</b> - There is no file quota limit for any one of our web hosting packages. You are allowed to have an unlimited number of files in your hosting account.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Disk
Space &amp; Traffic </b>- Ktm Webhosting offers generous
amounts of
disk space and network bandwidth. Customers must not allow other
websites or hosting servers to link to files stored in their hosting
accounts, and thus steal network traffic. In order to escape unjust
distribution of the resources, as well as possible sharing of
illegal content, Customers are not allowed to use their hosting
accounts as a remote storage server only or solely for the purpose
of sharing (un)archived images, programs or sound files. At least 80% of all files and/or total megabytes used (including MP3, WAV, RA, GIF, JPG, ZIP, RAR, but not limited to these file types) in each hosting account must be a part of actual, active website(s) content, i.e. all content files must have corresponding HTML or PHP files that link to them. Audio, graphics and/or video files must be must be under 25% of the current web hosting disk usage and must never exceed 50 GB in size. Furthermore, such media files may amount to no more than 50% of the customer's total monthly traffic usage. Upon request, each Customer must be able to prove that a given file is a constituent part of an actual page and not only stored on the server within 24 hours of the request. If the client fails to react within 24 hours after the request and does not remove the file/files in question, or if the apportioned traffic quota continues to be used for such purposes - the Provider reserves the right to suspend the account and/or to remove the aforesaid content from the server.  In such cases, refunds are not applicable and the money-back guarantee is no longer valid..</p>

        <p><b>MySQL
usage</b> - each database hosted in our system can be used only
by
the user who created it. Another user, whose account is hosted on
the same or on another server, cannot use the database created in
the first-mentioned customer account. The MySQL database has a limit
of 45,000 queries per hour. If you have reached 45,000 queries per a
given hour, you will not be able to make any more queries. In the
next hour you will have access to the database again and the counter
will be reset. You can make a maximum of 15 simultaneous connections
to a MySQL database.</p>

<p>"UNLIMITED" USAGE POLICIES AND DEFINITIONS</p><br>
    <p>
The term “UNLIMITED” is used to describe the amount of resources in the web hosting plans provided by Ktm Webhosting, which is not set to a predefined limit value (for example - unlimited bandwidth, unlimited disk space, unlimited emails or other unlimited resources). By not setting limits on key resources, we are able to offer our customers a simple, consistent pricing scheme as their websites demand more and more resources. As a result, a typical website may experience periods of great popularity and a resulting increased storage need without experiencing any associated increase in hosting charges.<br>
   <br>
In all cases, when a service is listed as “Unlimited“, it is intended for normal web hosting usage only - all activities, which may result in excessive resource usage inconsistent with regular usage patterns, are prohibited.<br>
   <br>
Our Unlimited service offers are not designed to allow a single user to influence the overall server performance. Ktm Webhosting will make every effort to provide its customers with additional resources whenever possible, including the relocation of a customer's hosting account to a newer, faster server. However, if the resource usage reaches a level where it may influence the overall server performance in a negative way, Ktm Webhosting reserves the right to take corrective actions. Such actions may include disconnection or discontinuance of any and of all offered services, removal or deletion of customers' websites, website content, electronic mail, or termination of a customer's account according to Ktm Webhosting's sole and absolute discretion.</p><br>

CHARGEBACKS</p><br>
    <p>
Chargebacks
are not
considered as a way of refunding. Any Customer who initiates a credit
card chargeback in response to a bill or order placed at Ktm Webhosting will be subject
to full investigation. </p>
    <p>
When
signing up for
a web hosting account with Ktm Webhosting, customers agree to the
conditions explicated in our Acceptable
Use
Policy (AUP) and the Web Hosting Terms of
Service (this
document). Thus, Ktm Webhosting, as well as our authorized retailers
(PayPal, WorldPay, 2CheckOut), will resort to these documents as an
evidence for the Customer's agreement, especially in the event that
a Customer sends a chargeback inquiry based on points that he/or she
first accepted, but is trying now to refute.</p>
    <p>
If/When
a chargeback
report is received, the first step of our Ktm Webhosting team will
be to try to contact the user. Meanwhile, the user account will be
suspended (in order to protect our system from fraudulent activity
and misuse) and will remain suspended until the reasons for the
chargeback have been clarified and decision has been taken for
according action. </p>
    <p>If
the chargeback
has occurred due to some misunderstanding, a reverse payment
procedure will be initiated with our authorized retailers and the
account will be re-activated. </p>
    <p>If
the user has sent
a chargeback request based on groundless argumentation (to our own
judgment and these Web Hosting Terms of Service), then a dispute will
be started with our authorized retailers in which the Web Hosting
Terms of Service (this document) and the Acceptable
Use Policy of Ktm Webhosting will serve as
proof of the
Customer's agreement. The retailers then, taking into consideration
all provisions in these legal documents, will decide whether the
Customer has had sufficient grounds for the chargeback or Ktm Webhosting
has the right to a reverse payment.</p>
    <p>In
case that the
chargeback originates from a fraudulent user and no reverse payment
procedure can be initiated, then the respective hosting account will
remain suspended. </p>
